2025-02-14 12:40:42,184 - 4594 - agent.agentlab_agent - INFO - [Reward Reasoning]: Thought: Let's think step-by-step. The instruction is to search for flights to Tokyo for February 1 and February 2, 2025. The agent has successfully typed "Tokyo" into the "Where to?" combobox, which is the first step in the process. The agent then clicked on the 'Departure' textbox to open the date selection dialog, which is necessary for selecting the travel dates. The agent selected 'Saturday, February 1, 2025', and then also selected 'Sunday, February 2, 2025'. At this point, the agent has completed the necessary steps to input the required information for the flight search. However, the agent has not yet clicked the search button to initiate the search for flights. Therefore, while significant progress has been made, the task is not fully completed.. Answer: 4
